            <p>So she went in to her mother, and as she arrived thus covered
            with gold, she was well received, both by her and her sister.</p>

            <p>The girl told all that had happened to her; and as soon as the
            mother heard how she had come by so much wealth, she was very
            anxious to obtain the same good luck for the ugly and lazy daughter.
            She had to seat herself by the well and spin; and in order that her
            shuttle might be stained with blood, she stuck her hand into a
            thorn-bush and pricked her finger. Then she threw her shuttle into
            the well, and jumped in after it.</p>

            <p>She came, like the other, to the beautiful meadow and walked
            along the very same path. When she got to the oven the bread again
            cried, "Oh, take me out! take me out! or I shall burn; I have been
            baked a long time!" But the lazy thing answered, "As if I had any
            wish to make myself dirty!" and on she went. Soon she came to the
            apple-tree, which cried,"Oh, shake me! shake me! we apples are all
            ripe!" But she answered, "I like that! one of you might fall on my
            head," and so went on.</p>

            <p>When she came to Mother Holle’s house she was not afraid, for she
            had already heard of her big teeth, and she hired herself to her
            immediately.</p>

            <aside class="pquote">
                <blockquote>
                    <h3>"...instead of the gold, black tar was emptied over her."</h3>
                </blockquote>
            </aside>

            <p>The first day she forced herself to work hard, and obeyed Mother
            Holle when she told her to do anything, for she was thinking of all
            the gold that she would give her. But on the second day she began to
            be lazy, and on the third day still more so, and then she would not
            get up in the morning at all. Neither did she make Mother Holle’s
            bed as she ought, and did not shake it so as to make the feathers
            fly up. Mother Holle was soon tired of this, and gave her notice to
            leave. The lazy girl was willing enough to go, and thought that now
            the golden rain would come. Mother Holle led her, too, to the great
            door; but while she was standing beneath it, instead of the gold,
            black tar was emptied over her. "That is the reward of your
            service," said Mother Holle, and shut the door.</p>

            <p>So the lazy girl went home; but she was quite covered with tar,
            and the cock by the well-side, as soon as he saw her, cried:
            "Cock-a-doodle-doo! Your tarred girl’s come back to you." But the
            tar stuck fast to her, and could not be got off for a very long
            time.</p>
