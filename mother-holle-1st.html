        <article class="part1">
            <p>There was once a widow who had two daughters — one
            of whom was pretty and hard-working, while the other was ugly and
            lazy. But she was much fonder of the ugly and lazy one, because she
            was her own daughter; and the other, who was a step-daughter, had to
            do all the work, and be the Cinderella of the house. Every day the
            poor girl had to sit by a well, in the highway, and spin and spin
            till her fingers bled.</p>

            <p>Now it happened that one day the shuttle, which an important part
            on a spinning wheel, was marked with her blood, so she dipped it in
            the well, to wash the mark off; but it dropped out of her hand and
            fell to the bottom. She began to cry, and ran to her step-mother and
            told of the mishap. But she scolded her sharply, and was so
            merciless as to say,"Since you have let the shuttle fall in, you
            must fetch it out again."
            </p>

            <p>So the girl went back to the well, and did not know what to do;
            and in the sorrow of her heart she jumped into the well to get the
            shuttle. She lost her senses; and when she awoke and came to herself
            again, she was in a lovely meadow where the sun was shining and many
            thousands of flowers were growing. Along this meadow she went, and
            at last came to a baker’s oven full of bread, and the bread cried
            out, "Oh, take me out! take me out! or I shall burn; I have been
            baked a long time!" So she went up to it, and took out all the
            loaves one after another with the bread-shovel. After that she went
            on till she came to a tree covered with apples, which called out to
            her, "Oh, shake me! shake me! we apples are all ripe!" So she shook
            the tree till the apples fell like rain, and went on shaking till
            they were all down, and when she had gathered them into a heap, she
            went on her way.</p>

            <p>At last she came to a little house, out of which an old woman
            peeped; but she had such large teeth that the girl was frightened,
            and was about to run away.</p>

            <aside class="pquote">
                <blockquote>
                    <h3>"What are you afraid of, dear child?"</h3>
                    <h3>- Mother Holle</h3>
                </blockquote>
            </aside>

            <p>But the old woman called out to her, "What are you afraid of,
            dear child? Stay with me; if you will do all the work in the house
            properly, you shall be the better for it. Only you must take care to
            make my bed well, and to shake it thoroughly till the feathers
            fly—for then there is snow on the earth. I am Mother Holle."</p>

            <p>As the old woman spoke so kindly to her, the girl took courage
            and agreed to enter her service. She attended to everything to the
            satisfaction of her mistress, and always shook her bed so vigorously
            that the feathers flew about like snow-flakes. So she had a pleasant
            life with her; never an angry word; and boiled or roast meat every
            day.</p>

            <p>She stayed some time with Mother Holle, and then she became sad.
            At first she did not know what was the matter with her, but found at
            length that it was homesickness; although she was many times better
            off here than at home, still she had a longing to be there. At last
            she said to the old woman, "I have a longing for home; and however
            well off I am down here, I cannot stay any longer; I must go up
            again to my own people." Mother Holle said, "I am pleased that you
            long for your home again, and as you have served me so truly, I
            myself will take you up again." Thereupon she took her by the hand,
            and led her to a large door. The door was opened, and just as the
            maiden was standing beneath the doorway, a heavy shower of golden
            rain fell, and all the gold remained sticking to her, so that she
            was completely covered with it.</p>

            <p>"You shall have that because you are so hard-working," said
            Mother Holle; and at the same time she gave her back the shuttle
            which she had let fall into the well. Thereupon the door closed, and
            the maiden found herself up above upon the earth, not far from her
            mother’s house.</p>

            <p>And as she went into the yard the cock cried: "Cock-a-doodle-doo!
            Your golden girl’s come back to you!"</p>
